# Contributing to Chaser the Python

Chaser the Python is an open source project. Anyone is welcome to help make this game better! Before making
contributions, here are a few things you should know.

## Code of Conduct
We have an extensive documentation on the **[code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**,
please make sure you read through it carefully.

## Development Process
All changes should be submitted through GitHub. All pull requests, internal or
external, will go through the same review process.

## Semantic Versioning
We follows **[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)**. We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for any breaking changes. When we make breaking changes, we also introduce deprecation warnings in a minor version so that our users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance.

We tag every pull request with a label marking whether the change should go in the next patch, minor, or a major version. We release new patch versions every few weeks, minor versions every few months, and major versions one or two times a year.

Every significant change is documented in the changelog file.

 ## Bugs
 ### Where to Find Known Issues
 We are using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesnâ€™t already exist.
 
 ### Reporting New Issues
 Please use our issue templates for file any bugs found.
 
 ### Security Bugs
 For security bugs, because of the sensitivity nature of the issues, please follow the security bug template instead.
